# Supervised Learning with scikit-learn

## Course Description

> Grow your machine learning skills with scikit-learn and discover how to use this popular Python library to train models using labeled data. In this course, you'll learn how to make powerful predictions, such as whether a customer is will churn from your business, whether an individual has diabetes, and even how to tell classify the genre of a song. Using real-world datasets, you'll find out how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and determine how well they will perform with unseen data.

## What will be covered

* Using supervised learning techniques to build predictive models
* For both regression and classification problems
* Underfitting and overfittng
* How to split data
* Cross-validation
* Data preprocessing techniques
* Model selection
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Model performance evaluation
* Using pipelines

## Course Chapters

### [Chapter 1: Classification](https://github.com/PavlosIsaris/Supervised-Learning-with-scikit-learn/tree/main/1_Classification)

> In this chapter, you'll be introduced to classification problems and learn how to solve them using supervised learning techniques. You'll learn how to split data into training and test sets, fit a model, make predictions, and evaluate accuracy. Youâ€™ll discover the relationship between model complexity and performance, applying what you learn to a churn dataset, where you will classify the churn status of a telecom company's customers.

### Chapter 1 Details

* Binary Classification
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Measuring Model Performance
* Train/test split and computing accuracy
* Overfitting and underfitting
* Visualizing Model Complexity

### [Chapter 2: Regression](https://github.com/PavlosIsaris/Supervised-Learning-with-scikit-learn/tree/main/2_Regression)

> In this chapter, you will be introduced to regression, and build models to predict sales values using a dataset on advertising expenditure. You will learn about the mechanics of linear regression and common performance metrics such as R-squared and root mean squared error. You will perform k-fold cross-validation, and apply regularization to regression models to reduce the risk of overfitting.

### Chapter 2 Details

* Introduction to Regression
* Linear Regression
* Cross-validation
* Regularized Regression
* Lasso Regression

### [Chapter 3: Fine-Tuning Your Model](https://github.com/PavlosIsaris/Supervised-Learning-with-scikit-learn/tree/main/3_Fine_tuning_your_model)

> Having trained models, now you will learn how to evaluate them. In this chapter, you will be introduced to several metrics along with a visualization technique for analyzing classification model performance using scikit-learn. You will also learn how to optimize classification and regression models through the use of hyperparameter tuning.

### Chapter 3 Details

* How good is your model?
* Logistic Regression and the ROC curve
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
* Hyperparameter tuning with `RandomizedSearchCV`

### [Chapter 4: Preprocessing and Pipelines](https://github.com/PavlosIsaris/Supervised-Learning-with-scikit-learn/tree/main/4_Preprocessing_and_Pipelines)

> Learn how to impute missing values, convert categorical data to numeric values, scale data, evaluate multiple supervised learning models simultaneously, and build pipelines to streamline your workflow!

### Chapter 4 Details

* Preprocessing data
* Creating dummy variables
* Handling / Dropping missing data
* Centering and Scaling (Regression / Classification)
* Evaluating multiple models
* Visualizing Regression model performance
* Visualizing Classification model performance
