# Chapter 1 - Classification with scikit-learn

## Outline

> In this chapter, you'll be introduced to classification problems and learn how to solve them using supervised learning techniques. You'll learn how to split data into training and test sets, fit a model, make predictions, and evaluate accuracy. Youâ€™ll discover the relationship between model complexity and performance, applying what you learn to a churn dataset, where you will classify the churn status of a telecom company's customers.
