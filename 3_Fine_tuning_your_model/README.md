# Chapter 3 - Fine-tuning your model

## Outline

> Having trained models, now you will learn how to evaluate them. In this chapter, you will be introduced to several metrics along with a visualization technique for analyzing classification model performance using `scikit-learn`. You will also learn how to optimize classification and regression models through the use of hyperparameter tuning.

## Chapter Details

* How good is your model?
* Logistic Regression and the ROC curve
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
* Hyperparameter tuning with `RandomizedSearchCV`
